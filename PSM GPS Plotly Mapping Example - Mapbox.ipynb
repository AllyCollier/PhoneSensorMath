    "### Plotly Mapping Example ###\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook is designed to accept a comma-separated (csv) list of timestamped GPS latitude and longitude coordinates representing a recording of a walking or running exercise and create a scatter plot of the coordinates on a map. While it is taylored to work with the output from the __[Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite app](https://www.vieyrasoftware.net/)__, we have tried to make the instructions here agnostic to the method of GPS recording used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the __[Plotly](https://plot.ly)__ plotting library and the __[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)__ mapping library. Both libraries are free for non-commercial use (with some minor limitations) and are suitable for use by students and instructors in academic data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Keys ####\n",
    "In order to use this notebook, you must acquire a free Plotly API Key (__[instructions](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/)__) and a free Mapbox access token(__[instructions](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/)__). This notebook will _not_ function unless you acquire these access tokens and insert them in the second input cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Input File Specification ####\n",
    "What follows assumes that the input .csv file resembles:\n",
    "```\n",
    "time,Latitude,Longitude,,\n",
    "08:29:14:458,37.38775891,-6.00309754,\n",
    "08:29:15:460,37.38774677,-6.00311591,\n",
    "08:29:16:448,37.38774284,-6.00313017,\n",
    "08:29:18:468,37.38775696,-6.00314697,\n",
    "08:29:19:463,37.38776887,-6.00314499,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```time``` column has timestamps for each reading. The timestamps are colon-separated values of the form hours:minutes:seconds:fraction_seconds. For example, the first timestamp occurred at 8 hours, 29 minutes and 14.458 seconds after midnight local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Latitude``` column value is latitude from the equator (0 degrees) with northern latitudes positive and southern latitudes negative. The values to the right of the decimal point are _decimal_ fractions of a degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Longitude``` column value is the longitude from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees) with eastern longitudes positive and western longitudes negative. The values to the right of the decimal point are _decimal_ fractions of a degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ There can be other columns present in the csv file, but in order for this notebook to function properly, these columns must be present with these column header names (case-sensitive) and these value specifications.\n",
