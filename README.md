# PhoneSensorMath
A repository of math-oriented projects that incorporate data from sensors
found in typical cell phones. The projects are all rendered in jupyter
notebooks that have markdown annotations. To use these, download the .ipynb
and associated .csv files to your computer. Load the .ipynb file into
jupyter, modify to suit your needs.

## GPS Fastest Mile Analysis
This notebook describes the collection and analysis of GPS data recorded
during an exercise run/walk/bike. The analysis allows one to determine the
fastest mile within the longer exercises course. The notebook is documented
so that other lengths (i.e. kilometer) can be considered. Such an analysis
might accompany an introductory calculus curriculum about time vs.
distance.

## Accelerometer Frequency Analysis
This notebook describes the collection and analysis of phone accelerometer
data recorded while the phone rested on a clothes washer during its spin
cycle. The rate of spin is determined by using the discrete Fourier
transform and identifying the dominant frequency of vibration in the
accelerometer data. This analysis might accompany an engineering math
course as it discusses the discrete Fourier transform.
